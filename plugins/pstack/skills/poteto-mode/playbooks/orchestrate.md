### Orchestrate

Pick reasoning effort for the job under the Subagents section of **poteto-mode**, using only the active execution tool’s supported values.

**You run the program, never the code. Decide which agent does each piece of work, then check what each one produces.** For a standing project handed to one coordinator chat: multi-day, many stacked PRs, dozens to hundreds of subagents, few human turns. One task driven to a predicate is Autonomous run. One ambitious run that needs a bespoke workflow is figure-it-out. Work that one agent could finish inside the session's budget is not a program.

Run it with your own tools. Spawn workers in the background with `spawn_agent`. Keep the program's state in the session's task list plus a durable store the coordinator owns, `<repo>/.codex/pstack-runs/<run-name>/`. Codex has no PR or CI event subscription, so check live state with `gh` when you need it; a saved heartbeat wake (see CODEX.md) is the closest stand-in for a scheduled re-check. Call no scripts, run no polling loops, and never relay messages or status between agents.

#### Topology

- **One owner per PR.** The owner is the only writer of its branch and carries the PR from build to merge. Only the owner pushes, rebases, or retargets it. Closing or retargeting a base PR orphans every PR above it, so the owner does that only on your call. You never author or edit code. Conflicted merges, chain rebases, and fixes go to owners.
- **A fresh worker for each independent task.** Its kickoff carries everything it needs, including each upstream report it depends on, pasted in full. Workers can't see their siblings. Give each worker an explicit worktree or working-directory boundary and permission constraints in its brief, unless the work needs this checkout: a live surface check, transcripts under `~/.codex/sessions/` for this workspace, a simulator, or auth that exists only here. A worktree starts from committed state, so briefs inline what the worker needs or point at repo paths. Workers run on this host, so cap concurrent worktrees and builds at what it sustains, and remove each worktree when its unit lands. Pick each subagent's reasoning effort for the job, per the Subagents section.
- **A sub-coordinator only when one area has many parallel workers.** It owns that area's workers and kickoffs and sends you one rollup, never raw worker reports. Stop at three levels: you, sub-coordinators, and workers. Delegate nested workers only when the current host permits it; otherwise the root dispatches those briefs. Keep about ten workers in flight per coordinator, bounded by actual host capacity, and start the next one as each finishes instead of waiting on a whole batch.
- **Send a follow-up when new work needs a worker's built state,** such as its checkout, uncommitted changes, or a running process. Message a worker only for a follow-up on the same work. Never message one to check on it, because a message restarts an idle agent.
- **Each PR gets a verifier that isn't its author,** on a different configured model when available; report when only one model is available. The owner merges only on that verifier's pass at the current head.
- **Start with one unit.** Take it through kickoff, owner, verifier, and merge before you fan out, so a flaw in the kickoff costs one agent instead of fifty. On near-identical cheap units, the first unit is that test.

#### Supervision

- **Each kickoff names the evidence that proves the work is done,** such as a command and its expected output, a live-surface check, or an artifact. It also names the goal, the paths the worker may and may not write, and the actions it must not take. If you can't name the evidence, the unit isn't scoped yet.
- **Read the diff or the artifact, not only the worker's summary.** Green CI is an input to a verdict, not a verdict. Behavioral work needs more than a type check. A verdict covers one head SHA, so a new push needs a new verdict. Read a sample of each sub-coordinator's kickoffs while its workers run, and fix its instructions when one fails.
- **Send back work that drifts from scope or grows past what was asked.** Keep only the fixes that block the program, and park the rest as follow-ups.
- **Check a PR's live state before you report on it,** with `gh pr view` and `gh pr checks`, not the worker's last report. Account for every worker you spawned as done, replaced, or absorbed into another worker's scope.
- **Stop or replace a worker that stalls or loops.** Judge it by its pushes and PR activity, not its status text. Retry by cause: a smaller scope after a context or memory limit, the same kickoff after a dropped connection, and a different model after a tool error. After two retries, drop the unit and replan around it. When a stopped worker returns late, check its result against the PR's current state, and hand any unique findings to a fresh worker.
- **Ask the user only for a real decision or a blocker,** such as an irreversible action, a product or preference call that no experiment settles, or a dead end that survived a replan. Rebase mechanics, retries, CI flakes, review triage, and "should I keep going" never reach the user.

**Reply:** what landed against the goal, each PR's live state and verdict with its link, what was dropped and why, and the decisions waiting on the user.
